/*
 VI monitoring board

 This class facilitates access to VI-board readings

 The file vimon_cal.h contains the claibration data
 specific to a particular board and it components.

 The board Uses precision voltage source at 2.048V on the OpAmp

 Ch0: V1 10.0V to 16.0V = 0 to 2.048V
 Ch1: V2 or PT100 0 to 2.03V = 90 to 134 Ohm = -25 to +88 DegC
 Ch2: I1
 Ch3: I2

 Current sensor INA180A1 gain is 20
 Example: 50mV/50A on Shunt = 1V on Analog Input for 50A
          50mA per mV
